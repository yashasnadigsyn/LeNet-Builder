Hi! I'm **Yashas**, a student of Machine Learning @ Ramaiah University of Applied Sciences.

This is just a simple version of LeNet builder. I am still learning Deep Learning. This is my first prototype.
I learnt about LeNet today and was fascinated by it and built this. I am gonna add new features everytime i learn something new about DL.

Thank You!
